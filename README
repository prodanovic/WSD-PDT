Welcome to the WSD system!
Running of the system (on any OS) consists of running the WSD.jar with the command: 
java -jar WSD.jar

When the program is started, 3 simple steps need to be completed in order for the system to perform WSD. 
1. insert the preprocessing and evaluation parameters. If this option is left blank the system will take 
the default parameters. Please consult the table 8.1 in Chapter 8 of the thesis to see which are the expected
data types for the parameters, as well what the default values for the parameters are

2. give the system a path to the file which it will use for training. If the training was already performed
this step can be skipped. The system expects a file in SGML format, with a tag set of PDT1.0.

3. give the system a path to the file containing the test set. Test set file should hold one sentence per line
, and ambiguous words should be give in the form "lemma-number", order for the system to be able to perform
evaluation. 

Results are displayed in the end. More detailed results are to be found in a log. More on logs and logs
name format can be found in Chapter 8.2. of the thesis. 

If you wish to re-create the experiments whose results are documented in the thesis you need to run the 
classes TfIdfExperiment, PmiExperiment, RandomIndexingExperiment in the experiments package. These classes 
represent batch evaluations, like the one where different document size were experimented with, or different
evaluation context size. In order to run each of these batch evaluations individually, you need to comment
out appropriate method in  the line 55 for each model. Every model is trained on the same text that is 
cleaned from PDT SGML and prepared for pre-processing.
