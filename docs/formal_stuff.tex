\noindent
At a very high risk of sounding extremely clich\'ed I do have to say that I am profoundly grateful for the chance of being exposed to such exciting areas of CL and NLP. The decision to take the the two years off work and attend this program was (unintentionally) one of the best decisions of my life. Of course I would not be able to struggle all the challenges without the constant support of my family, my love  and my friends. I also wish to thank all the wonderful people from the program, both teachers and colleagues for equally helping me thrive in the areas of my interest. Lastly I wish to thank the Erasmus Mundus organization for supporting the LCT program and giving  a chance to non--European students to attend truly excellent studies.

Abstrakt:
In statistical models of semantics word meanings are based solely on their distributional properties. 
The core resource here is a single lexicon that can be used for a variety of tasks, where word meanings are represented as vectors in Vector Space, and word 
similarities as distances between their vector representations. Using strengths of similarities, appropriateness of terms given a 
particular context can be calculated and used for a variety of tasks, one of them being Word Sense Disambiguation.
\newline
In this thesis several different approaches to models of Vector Space were examined and implemented in order to cross 
evaluate their performance on the Word Sense Disambiguation task in Prague Dependency Treebank.
