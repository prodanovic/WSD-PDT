\chapter*{Summary}
The primary task of this Master's thesis was to perform Word Sense Disambiguation on the Prague 
Dependency Treebank dataset. Through parameter tunning and comparing three different Vector Space Models,
results comparable to some of the state--of--the--art approaches were achieved (on a different data 
set). Findings of the thesis that stem from model comparing are that the models that do not perform
any matrix reduction operation on the co--occurrence matrix are the ones giving better results. 
Computation time for non-reducing models is also better. 

Implementation of the system was made so that through passing of parameters through command line
anyone can perform experiments without the need to look into the source code. Also, a data set can 
be easily switched (for the system to be trained on and evaluated) also through passing the command
line argument containing the location of the file that holds the data set.
